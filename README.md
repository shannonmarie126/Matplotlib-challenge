# Matplotlib-challenge
combined table: merged table of first two data frames, shows Mouse IDs, time points, volumes, treatments, sex and age. 
cleaned table: same as above with a duplicate mouse removed
by tumor volume: statistics of tumor volume categorized by treatment/drug regimen
Figure 1: Drug Regimen vs # of Mouse Timepoints: Count of data points for each drug treatment, they all range from 150-200 data points. 
Figure 2: Pie chart of unique mice ID split by gender, shows a close to 50/50 split of gender (this is good to decrease chance for outside influence(confounding variable) based on gender discrepencies) 
Table displaying mice at their last timepoint only in order to vvisualize and plot the final tumor size. 
Figure 3: Box Plot of four different drug regimens, shows the Q1,median and Q3 in the box with the whiskers being the upper and lower bounds for outliers, the one outlier is represented in red. This suggests the data trends more towards normal since their are less outliers to skew the data. 
Figure 4: Tumor Volume vs Timepoint for mouse s710 on the Capomulin treatment: shows the tumor volume over time for a specific mouse, shows initial decrease followed by an increase then another decrease with an overall decrease in volume by the end of the study/data. 
Figure 5/6: scatter plot of average tumor volume vs weight: 5 shows the relationship between the weight of the mouse and tumor size, but without the line of regression we can see a positive correlation. 6 adds the line of regression and a pearsons coefficent showing a close to 1:1 relationship between weight and tumor volume with an Rsquared value of 0.84 which means a relatively high correlation between the variables.
